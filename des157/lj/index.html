            <h2>Best practices for form design</h2>
            <p id="date">Jan 20, 2021</p>
            <p class="text">
                The best practices for form design involve making the process easy and efficient for the user. The form 
                should be one column in order to make the information easy to scan. I have experienced paperwork in the past 
                (usually government paperwork) that tried to fill a whole page with various sized boxes and questions. This style 
                form is confusing because everything is crammed together and you can easily miss certain sections. The article also 
                mentioned some methods to make filling out information easier for the user such as including the easy questions 
                first. When someone starts filling out a form they donâ€™t know what to expect, so the easy or obvious questions are 
                usually better to start with. Towards the end it would make sense to include longer questions that may require the 
                user to find certain materials such as a credit card or paperwork. It was also mentioned to not include a clear or 
                reset button. I had previously thought that this would be a good feature, but I can see how it may be frustrating if 
                the button were accidentally pressed, especially if it was next to the submit button.
