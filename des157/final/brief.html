            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p id="no">
                I will be creating an online shop where the style of the website is inspired by the design of the items/clothing.
            </p>

            <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>
            <p> 
                Zara is a clothing store that uses an editorial and high-end fashion approach for the 
                style of their website. I like how when you first visit the page, there is a short 
                slideshow where you can browse each section of the website (mens, womens, or kids 
                clothing). The slideshow uses a smooth scroll feature where it moves fast then slows 
                down to set the picture on the screen. Additionally, I like the styling of the content 
                that corresponds with each photo of the item. A picture for a pair of jeans had the 
                title “denim” in an interesting font overlapping the photo, while the rest of the 
                information was listed below in a simpler font and style. Finally, there is an 
                interesting use of layouts for the items, such as having three pictures fill the 
                width of the screen and have the second space left empty, while the next row only 
                has two photos side by side. <br><br>

            </p>

            <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>
            <p> 
                I like the timing of the interactive animations on Timothée Roussilhe’s website. 
                As you scroll down different parts of the page move onto the screen from different 
                directions at different speeds. For example the title and short text blurb move 
                onto the screen from opposite sides, while the picture beside them floats in. Also, 
                the photos have a timed overlay where you don’t need to hover over the photo, but 
                as you move down the screen the overlay moves up to reveal the photo. Additionally, 
                there is a number on the right that changes based on which section you are on. The 
                transition resembles an analog clock that rotates to reveal the next number. <br><br>

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p> 
                Similar to the websites mentioned above, I plan to create an online shop experience 
                that has personality rather than a list of items to look at in basic rows and columns. 
                I want to create additional small design graphics and assets to place on top of some of 
                the photos. I want to use a variation of styles for the rows of photos, and integrate a 
                small slideshow at the beginning when first opening the webpage. Some photos will take 
                the user to a separate page dedicated for that design, and have more information on the 
                product. When displaying the photos in the main page, overlays will be used to expose 
                certain items as you scroll down.
            </p>

            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p> 
                Colors for the website will be taken directly from the designs of the items in the photos. 
                Most of the text will be in a thin and small dark colored font, to place more attention to 
                the photos. The title of each design or item may stand out in a larger size and elaborate 
                font. Photos with the same design (either fish, fossil, hearts, or lollipop) will be grouped 
                together in various combinations, there will not be one set style of row or column. More 
                space is placed between the different designs. Overlays for the photos will have the 
                same color and font for any text on top.
            </p>

            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
            <p> 
                Most of the slideshows will be time based. Like my original studio project, I want 
                a few images to continually change within the same spot. This slideshow could either 
                show different color combinations or arrangements of the same item. There will be no 
                explicit buttons to get to additional pages within the website, but rather the user 
                can click the title or photo of the item. I may use a transition in the size or opacity 
                of these features in order to make it easier to understand that those items are interactive. 
                I will utilize a smooth scrolling effect, especially when clicking on an icon that leads to 
                a portion of the page that is further down. Also, I will use a smooth scroll for the initial 
                slideshow when looking through a general overview of the designs on the page.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p> 
                The experience I hope to achieve is an online shop with a gallery of different items to look 
                through. The goal is to showcase each unique design on as many items as possible. Additional 
                illustrations and graphics in the same style and colors of the design will be used to unify 
                each specific collection of photos and give the user a better idea of what the designs represent. 
                The user can go to specific pages for each of the 4-5 designs to learn more about the artwork.
                 Also, there will be information about the products such as size and materials. I want the user 
                 to enjoy looking through all the items like a gallery show rather than provide an experience 
                 that pushes them to look for a specific item.
