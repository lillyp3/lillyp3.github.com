                The first observation I made through user testing was that each user 
                thought that the color palette I provided for each design were buttons 
                that would change the color of the background. A second observation was 
                that it was slightly confusing for the user to understand that by closing 
                out of the information/video for one design you need to click on another. 
                The idea of clicking on the t-shirts is intuitive as the shirt is highlighted, 
                and users did not have a problem understanding the function of the “start” 
                and “about” buttons. The about page was easy to understand by everyone, 
                and one person suggested including thumbnail images below so the user can 
                choose a picture they want to stay on.

                The first video was not loading for each user, so I plan to correct that. 
                I will either add a label for the color palette squares or move them to 
                the about page so people do not confuse them for buttons. One person 
                suggested how the black outline for the videos was a bit jarring, 
                especially against the pastel backgrounds so I might go in and soften 
                some of the colors. Also, I will go in and clean the outlines of the 
                t-shirts because some of the crops are a little messy. Finally, I will 
                look into adding a feature that appears on the right when you hover over 
                the shirts that is different from the information displayed when you 
                click. This might be the name of the design or some description.
