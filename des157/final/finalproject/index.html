                <p><strong>01 Fish & Lilypad</strong><br><br>
                    This sketch was based off of a reference photo I took in San Diego, 
                    California at Balboa Park. At the park, there is this large pond 
                    that is filled with lily pads and swimming underneath are koi fish. 
                    Balboa Park is one of my favorite places to visit in California and 
                    I especially like seeing this pond. In my sketch, I wanted to show 
                    the different layers of the pond and the disbursement of lily pads 
                    and flowers. Beneath the plants are these bright and colorful koi 
                    fish that always catch my attention. To create the layering effect, 
                    I used the multiply tool to have the intersection between elements 
                    stand out.

                <p><strong>02 Fossil</strong><br><br>
                    This sketch was based on a few pressed flower images I saw online. 
                    I love saving fresh flowers and special moments in my life to hold 
                    onto the memory. This led me to thinking about fossils and how there 
                    is more focus on drawing fossils of bone skeletons rather than plant 
                    fossils. The fossil in my design is pink and red where the plant may 
                    have been pressed into a material like clay.

                <p><strong>03 Conversation Hearts</strong><br><br>
                    This sketch is one of my favorites because I made the design as a way 
                    to almost mock the idea of Valentine’s Day. This sketch was drawn 
                    about a week before Valentine’s Day as I was thinking about all the 
                    rejection and break ups that occur before the day. The conversation 
                    hearts are usually used to spread positive and cute messages of “Be Mine” 
                    or “I Love U.” My interpretation puts a twist on the “Be Mine” heart, 
                    where it shows a conversation where someone is rejected and accepts the 
                    message. This design is more humorous rather than sad, as it is making 
                    fun of the idea of giving someone these conversation hearts for their 
                    intended purpose.

                <p><strong>04 Heart Lollipop</strong><br><br>
                    The red heart shaped lollipop is very nostalgic for me because it reminds 
                    me of celebrating Valentine’s Day in elementary school. Valentine’s Day 
                    was a big holiday when I was little because everyone in my school classes 
                    would decorate boxes and bags to collect valentines from everyone in the 
                    class. This is the only time I truly celebrated Valentine’s Day, and I would 
                    always look forward to getting these lollipops. For some reason I never 
                    bought the lollipops or knew where they were sold, so it was always a treat 
                    I would be gifted from someone else.
